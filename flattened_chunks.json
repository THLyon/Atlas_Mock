Each Alternative Vehicle shall be controlled by the General Partner or an Affiliate thereof, shall be managed by the Fund Manager or an Affiliate thereof, and shall be governed by organizational documents containing provisions substantially the same in all material respects as those of the Fund (including this Agreement), with only such differences as may be required to accommodate the legal, tax or regulatory requirements referred to in Section 2.9.1.

The obligations of the General Partner and the Fund pursuant to this Section 14.7 (Clawback) shall survive (i) the removal and replacement of the General Partner and the Fund Manager pursuant to Article 10 (Removal of the General Partner; Termination of the Fund), and (ii) the dissolution and liquidation of the Fund, and shall at all times apply to any former General Partner with respect to the distributions to which it is entitled. For the avoidance of doubt, for the purposes of this Section 14.7 (Clawback) reference to the \"General Partner\" shall be interpreted to include any former General Partner. Capital Accounts. There shall be established on the books and records of the Fund a capital account (a \"Capital Account\") for each Partner. There shall be added to the Capital Account of each Partner (i) such Partner's Capital Contributions (including Liabilities of the Fund assumed by such Partner as provided in Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(c)) to the Fund and (ii) such Partner's distributive share of Net Income and any item in the nature of income or gain that is specially allocated to the Partner pursuant to Section 14.11 (Special Allocations). There shall be subtracted from the Capital Account of each Partner (i) the amount of any money (including Liabilities of such Partner assumed by the Fund as provided in Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(c)), and the Gross Asset Value of any other property, distributed to such Partner and (ii) such Partner's distributive share of Net Loss and any item in the nature of loss or expense that is specially allocated to such Partner pursuant to Section 14.10 (Loss Limitation) or Section 14.11 (Special Allocations). The foregoing provisions and the other provisions of this Agreement relating to the maintenance of Capital Accounts are intended to comply with Section 704(b) of the Code and Regulations Section 1.704-1(b), and shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with such Regulations. If the General Partner determines that it is prudent to modify the manner in which the Capital Accounts, or any debits or credits thereto, are computed in order to comply with such Regulations, the General Partner may make such modifications. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided herein, no Partner shall have any obligation to make up or otherwise make a Capital Contribution with respect to a deficit balance in its Capital Account. A negative balance in a Partner's Capital Account shall not create any Liability on the part of that Partner to any third party. General Application. Except as expressly provided herein, the items of income, gain, loss or deduction of the Fund comprising Net Income or Net Loss for a Fiscal Year shall be allocated by the General Partner among the Partners in a manner such that the Capital Account of each Partner, immediately after making such allocation, is, as nearly as possible, equal (proportionately) to:",

For the avoidance of doubt, in connection with each Drawdown from the Limited Partners other than a Drawdown pursuant to Section 6.2.4.4, the General Partner shall make Capital Contributions of its pro rata share of the amount required from the Limited Partners determined as if the General Partner were a Limited Partner with an applicable Remaining Commitment.",

In such event, prior to the time when the Fund first qualifies as a VCOC, any Capital Contributions of Benefit Plan Investors (and, if determined by the General Partner, other Partners) required by any Drawdown shall be deferred or contributed to an escrow fund established by the General Partner, which escrow fund is intended to comply with Department of Labor Advisory Opinion 95 04A (and, upon the release of such Capital Contributions to consummate a Portfolio Investment, all Temporary Investment Income earned thereon shall be either returned to the Partners in the same proportion as the Partners made such Capital Contributions or paid to the Fund on behalf of the applicable Partners as Capital Contributions). Return of Unused Capital Contributions. If any proposed Portfolio Investment with respect to which there has been a Drawdown is not consummated or if the amount of funds drawn down for any reason exceeds the amount necessary, as the case may be, the General Partner shall return such Drawdown or such excess amount of funds, together, in each case, with any interest or gains thereon (net of any Fund Expenses in respect thereof), to the Limited Partners within [sixty (60)] days of such Drawdown, in the same proportions that such funds were contributed by the Limited Partners. If at any time following the delivery of any Drawdown Notice it is intended to use any part of the relevant Drawdown for a purpose other than that specified in such Drawdown Notice then, at least ten (10) Business Days prior to such use, the General Partner shall provide to each Limited Partner a revised Drawdown Notice with the intention and the effect that each Limited Partner has the opportunity to exercise any right to be an Excused Limited Partner that it has with respect to such Drawdown pursuant to Section 6.7 (Excused Limited Partners). Reinvestment. The Remaining Commitments of each Limited Partner that are available to be drawn down shall be increased by the aggregate amount of Distributable Proceeds that have been distributed to such Limited Partner that equals the aggregate amount of Capital Contributions of such Limited Partner used to fund (i) the Acquisition Cost of Portfolio Investments that were realized within [twelve (12)] months of the acquisition thereof, and (ii) Fund Expenses, Management Fees and Organizational Expenses, provided in each case that such increased Remaining Commitments may be used solely for the purpose of making Portfolio Investments. Use of Distributable Proceeds to Fund Drawdowns. The General Partner may determine to retain and use Distributable Proceeds that otherwise would be distributed to a Limited Partner pursuant to Section 14.3 (Distribution of Distributable Proceeds) to fund all or part of any Capital Contribution that would otherwise be required to be made by such Limited Partner within [sixty (60)] days of the receipt of such Distributable Proceeds. At least ten (10) Business Days prior to the acquisition of a Portfolio Investment out of retained Distributable Proceeds, the General Partner shall provide to each Limited Partner the information required to be provided in a Drawdown Notice issued pursuant to Section 6.2.1 with the intention and the effect that each Limited Partner has the opportunity to exercise any right to be an Excused Limited Partner that it would have had pursuant to Section 6.7 (Excused Limited Partners) if the Acquisition Cost of such Portfolio Investment had been entirely funded by Drawdowns. Defaulting Partners. Subject to Section 6.7 (Excused Limited Partners), if any Partner fails to make all or any portion of any Capital Contribution or any other amount required to be funded by such Limited Partner pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or any corresponding agreement or with respect to any other Fund Vehicle (including, but not limited to, the obligation to return and contribute distributions to the Fund pursuant to Section 14.7 (Clawback) or Section 16.3 (Limited Partner Giveback)), the General Partner shall notify such Partner in writing of such failure (a \"Default Notice\"). If such failure continues for [five (5)] Business Days after receipt by such Limited Partner of the Default Notice, then such Partner shall be designated by the General Partner as in \"Default\" under this Agreement (a \"Defaulting Partner\") and shall thereafter be subject to the provisions of this Section 6.6 (Defaulting Partners). The General Partner may, if it determines this to be in the best interests of the Fund and the Non-Defaulting Partners, choose not to designate any Partner as a Defaulting Partner and may agree to waive or permit the cure of any Default by a Partner, subject to such conditions as the General Partner and the Defaulting Partner may agree upon, provided that any such decision not to designate any Affiliated Partner as a Defaulting Partner or to waive or permit the cure of any Default by an Affiliated Partner shall be subject to the prior written consent of the Advisory Committee. The General Partner shall inform the Limited Partners of the occurrence of any such Default and of any action taken by it with respect to any Defaulting Partner within [thirty (30)] days of the Defaulting Partner becoming a Defaulting Partner. A Limited Partner that fails to make all or any portion of any Capital Contribution or other payment required pursuant to this Agreement on the relevant Due Date shall pay or reimburse the Fund for any Damages resulting therefrom.",

In the event that the General Partner so determines to limit the information to be provided to a Limited Partner, the General Partner shall use reasonable best efforts to make such information available to such Limited Partner through an alternate means, provided that such information would not thereby become subject to public disclosure, and may to accomplish such objective limit the taking of notes or the photographing, printing, recording or otherwise documenting such information. Miscellaneous Confidentiality Matters. Any confidentiality agreement to which a Limited Partner may be required to agree in order to access any website maintained by the General Partner, the Fund Manager or the Fund for the purpose of making certain documents available or delivering notices to the Limited Partners (or for any other purpose) shall be subject to (and governed by) the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement, such that the terms of this Agreement shall control over any conflicting terms of the website. A Limited Partner shall not be obligated to return or destroy any information, including documents or copies of any documents, provided to the Limited Partner by the General Partner, the Fund Manager or the Fund to the extent such return or destruction would violate any law or document retention policy to which the Limited Partner is subject. Nothing in the Fund Documents shall prevent a Limited Partner from using any information furnished it regarding the Fund in connection with the exercise of its rights as a Limited Partner. Standard of Care. The General Partner and the Fund Manager each shall manage and control the Fund and its business and affairs reasonably and in good faith and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances. The foregoing duties apply to all investment decisions, delegations of authority, and all other acts or omissions of the General Partner or the Fund Manager under this Agreement or any other Fund Document. This Section 20.5 (Standard of Care) supplements, and does not replace, the fiduciary duties applicable to the General Partner or the Fund Manager, as the case may be, pursuant to the Act or any other applicable law. In the event of any inconsistency between this Section 20.5 (Standard of Care) and any other provision of this Agreement or of any other Fund Document, this Section 20.5 (Standard of Care) shall govern. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) the General Partner and the Fund Manager each shall exercise its \"good faith,\" \"discretion,\" \"sole discretion,\" \"reasonable discretion,\" \"reasonable and good faith discretion,\" or other subjective standard of care set forth in this Agreement in a manner consistent with this Section 20.5 (Standard of Care), and (ii) whenever taking an action or making a determination under this Agreement in its \"discretion,\" \"sole discretion,\" \"reasonable discretion,\" \"reasonable and good faith discretion,\" or under a grant of similar authority or latitude, each of the General Partner and the Fund Manager shall not place its interests or those of its Affiliates ahead of those of the Fund or the Limited Partners. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other Fund Documents constitute the entire agreement among the Fund, the General Partner, the Fund Manager and the Limited Partners with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede any prior agreement or understanding among them with respect to such subject matter. The representations and warranties of the Fund Parties and the Limited Partners herein and in the relevant Subscription Agreements shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement.",
